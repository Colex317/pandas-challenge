### PANDAS CHALLENGE

Create and manipulate Pandas DataFrames to analyze school and standardized test data.


### Background
You have been asked to analyze the district-wide standardized test results and have been given access to every student's math and reading scores and various information on the schools they attend. The task is to aggregate the data to showcase obvious trends in school performance.
      1.	Create a new repository for this project called pandas-challenge. 
      2.	Clone the new repository to your computer.
      3.	Inside your local Git repository, create a folder for this homework assignment and name it PyCitySchools.
      4.	Add your Jupyter notebook to this folder. This will be the main script to run for analysis.
      5.	Push these changes to GitHub or GitLab.


### Written Report

**Summary of the analysis:**

The dataset consisted of 15 schools; eight (8) are charter schools, and the other seven (7) are district schools. The total student count was 39,170, with a budget of $24,649,428. The mean Math score was 78.99, and the mean reading score was 81.88. The overall percentage passing was 65.17%
The highest performing schools by percentage overall passing indicate that the charter schools are performing better than the district-type schools, with the overall passing of 89.22 – 91.33 %. The district schools overall passing ranges from 52.98 – 54.64 %. The results also indicate that the charter schools are of small (< 1000 students) and medium (1000 – 2000) size, whereas all the district schools are categorized as large (2000 – 5000).

The spending range per student is higher for the district schools. The district schools (except for one, Bailey High) had spending ranges per student of $630 - $680; only the charter school (Thomas High) had a spending range per student of this amount ($630 - $680). The charter school spending ranges were less than $585 or within the $585 - $630 ranges (except for the earlier mentioned Thomas High).


**Two conclusions or comparisons from the calculations:**

The calculations indicate that spending higher ranges per student may not impact overall passing as the analysis showed that district schools spending ranges ($630 - $680) were higher than the spending range of the charter schools (< $585 or within the $585 - $630 ranges).

When we compare school size to average scores and percentage passing scores, we find that the small (< 1000 students) and medium (1000 – 2000) sized schools are outperforming the large (2000 – 5000) schools. 

- The average scores of small schools are 83.8 % average Math score, 83.9% average Reading scores, and percentage overall passing score was 89.9%
      
- Medium-sized schools had an average Math score of 83.3%, a Reading score of 83.9%, and a percentage overall passing score of 90.6%
      
- Whereas large-sized schools' average Math score is 77.7%, the Reading score is 81.3%, and the percentage overall passing score is 58.2%
          

Based on the findings, one could conclude that school size plays a more significant role in students' average scores and percentage overall passing than spending ranges per student.
